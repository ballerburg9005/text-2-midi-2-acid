Work, beloved ones, work, for this is a jihad... victory or martyrdom. We must make weapons, however simple, and strive to improve them every day to increase their destructive power and range, and strike the enemy who possesses all those military capabilities. Despite the simplicity of our weapons and our limited means, with God's help, we will create a new equation in the conflict, establishing a balance of terror and deterrence. They bombard us, so we bombard them. May God be pleased with Umar Ibn Al-Khattab, who said: "By God, if I found nothing but dust, I would fight them with it." And we, thank God, have much more than dust. We must fight them with everything we possess and always strive to enhance our capabilities. We are just beginning this battle, which the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, spoke of in the authentic hadith reported in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim: "The Hour will not come until you fight the Jews, and the stone will say, 'O Muslim, O servant of Allah, this is a Jew behind me; come and kill him.' This day is coming, and it is near, God willing.

Ibrahim, Hasan, and Adnan sit with plans for longer-range rockets in front of them for mortar shells. Ibrahim asks Adnan if it's technically possible in his workshop to execute these plans. Adnan scrutinizes the plans a second and third time, then nods in agreement. They jump to work, load what they've prepared into the car, and head to Beit Hanoun where they set up the rockets, light the fuse underneath, step back slightly and pray for success. Seconds later, the rocket roars off, crossing the border. The three mujahideen embrace and hurry back to prepare and manufacture more and to teach others in other areas.

Qassam rockets and others begin to launch by the dozens in response to this or that crime. Some voices tremble from the reaction of the occupation which begins to threaten and vow. Ibrahim smiles, saying: "What more can they do than what they have done nowâ€”assassinations, invasions, bombings, killings, and destruction? Now they must rebuild, to find something to destroy again." Adnan says, "Don't you see they're betting that people are tired and that the people want to rest, having been exhausted by the high price paid?" Ibrahim smiles and responds: "Who is tired? Who is exhausted? Our mothers and women who pay the price with the lives of their sons and their homes and everything dear to them, not one of them has spoken a word indicating fatigue. Haven't you seen every time a martyr's mother declares she is ready to sacrifice her other sons for Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa?"

Amidst the others who claim our people are exhausted, they are but a handful with political or economic interests, a small group. Yet, the enduring people are ready to sacrifice everything dear for their honor, dignity, and sanctities.

A boy not yet seventeen, dressed in a camouflaged military uniform and wearing a green cap inscribed with "There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the messenger of Allah," from the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, holds his rifle and several hand grenades. He enters "Abu Nidal's" house in Shuja'iyya, pushing the door into the courtyard, where Umm Nidal jumps up, saying: "My beloved son Muhammad, what is this?" The boy smiles and says, "Mother, I am going on a martyrdom operation." The mother pauses, then Muhammad asks, "Mother, do you remember this olive tree? The one under which Imad was martyred years ago? Do you remember it, mother? Do you remember Imad? And how we loved its fruit because it mingled with Imad's spirit? Remember how you raised us to love Palestine, Jerusalem, jihad, and sacrifice? The time has come, mother. I have seen myself storming their position, slaughtering them like sheep, then becoming a martyr, and I saw myself before the Prophet Muhammad in paradise, as he cheers for me, 'Bravo, Muhammad, bravo.'"

Tears well up in the mother's eyes. She pulls the edge of her scarf to wipe away the tears before they can fall down her cheeks, saying, "May Allah grant you success, my son, and make your aim true," then she embraces him, kissing his hands, his head, his rifle, advising him, "When you storm in, do not hesitate or look back, my son, and let no mercy for them in the religion of Allah take hold of you, my beloved." And until we meet in the eternal garden by the beloved Prophet, goodbye, my heart's joy, my soul's solace, goodbye. Muhammad kisses her head, then bends to kiss her hand, and sets off, saying, "Keep the mobile phone next to you; I will say my final goodbye from there," and leaves. Umm Nidal sits on her prayer rug, deep in her heart praying for her son's success and acceptance.

Muhammad crosses the barbed wires around the Etsion settlement, crawling towards the military religious institute inside. He activates his communicator, pressing a button. Umm Nidal, by the device at her side, hears, "I am here, mother, I have reached my target, dear, goodbye, mother, and see you in paradise," he says. He leaves the device open on his belt to broadcast the sound of the battle, advancing into the building, shouting "Allahu Akbar, Khaybar is out," throwing his grenades one after another, then storms the main hall firing his gun. Umm Nidal murmurs as she hears, "O Allah, make his shot true, for You are the shooter and Your shooting never misses." Gunfire is exchanged with the forces rushing to the site, and Muhammad falls chanting the Shahada, "I testify there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger." Umm Muhammad ululates in praise, "Praise be to Allah who honored me with his martyrdom, and I pray to Allah to reunite me with him in His mercy's abode."

As people gathered, one of the neighbors asked Umm Nidal, knowing that her son was going to his death, "You bid him farewell, yet you know he is going to die?" Umm Nidal replied, "By Allah, he is dearer to me than the world and all it contains, but he is worth sacrificing for the sake of Allah, for Jerusalem, and for Al-Aqsa. By Allah, I am ready to sacrifice Nidal, Hossam, and Rawad for the sake of Allah, for the honor of our people, and the dignity of our nation. I yearn for Allah's mercy to reunite us all in a place of truth by His side in the presence of the beloved Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him."
